title: T04A Results Card View (Everything)
---

This Results Card View shows the search results from a search input that is scoped to All Search Results, with the default card view activated. 

It is essentially the same template as other T04 variants, A or B, yet it logically loads the card view by default and has a mix of card types based on the result types.
